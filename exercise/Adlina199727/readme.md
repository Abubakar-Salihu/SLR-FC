Here are five recent articles on privacy-preserving data mining in the field of education:

1. "Privacy-preserving data (stream) mining techniques and their impact on data mining accuracy: a systematic literature review" published in the Artificial Intelligence Review on 22 February 2023¹. This study investigates existing input privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM) methods and privacy-preserving data stream mining methods (PPDSM), including their strengths and weaknesses¹.

2. "A comprehensive review on privacy preserving data mining" published in SpringerPlus². This review discusses the preservation of privacy in data mining as an absolute prerequisite for exchanging confidential information in terms of data analysis, validation, and publishing².

3. "Privacy-Preserving Data Mining: Models and Algorithms" published by Springer³. This book provides a survey of multiplicative perturbation for privacy-preserving data mining and a survey of quantification of privacy-preserving data mining algorithms³.

4. "Privacy-Preserving Data Mining: Methods, Metrics, and Applications" published in IEEE Xplore⁴. This paper surveys the most relevant PPDM techniques from the literature and the metrics used to evaluate such techniques and presents typical applications of PPDM methods in relevant fields⁴.

5. "A comprehensive review on privacy preserving data mining" published in SpringerOpen⁵. This is another comprehensive review on privacy preserving data mining⁵.
