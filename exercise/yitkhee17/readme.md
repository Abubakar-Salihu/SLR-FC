I can try to summarize the abstract of the above articles for you, but please note that this is not a substitute for reading the original papers. Here are the summaries:

- [Checks and Strategies for Enabling Code-Switched Machine Translation](^1^): This paper proposes methods to measure and improve the ability of multilingual NMT models to handle code-switched text, using Malay-English as one of the test languages.
- [Malay-English Neural Machine Translation System](^2^): This paper presents a tool to translate an English sentence into Malay and vice versa, using a transformer-based NMT model trained on a parallel corpus of Malay and English texts.
- [Neural Machine Translation with Code](^3^): This paper provides a tutorial on how to implement a simple NMT model using Python and Keras, with examples of English-German translation. The same code can be adapted for Malay-English translation with appropriate data and parameters.
- [Neural Machine Translation for Sinhala-English Code-Mixed Text](^4^): This paper proposes a data augmentation technique to improve the performance of NMT for Sinhala-English code-mixed text, which is similar to Malay-English code-mixed text in terms of linguistic features and challenges.
- [A Neural Machine Translation Approach for Translating Malay Parliament Proceedings into English]: This paper describes a NMT system for translating Malay parliament proceedings into English, using a transformer-based NMT model trained on a large-scale parallel corpus of Malay and English texts.

I hope these summaries are helpful to you. ðŸ˜Š
