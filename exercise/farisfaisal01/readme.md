I found some recent articles on text summarization that you might find interesting:

1. "Recent Progress on Text Summarization" ¹ is a paper that reviews recent approaches in three categories: Extractive, Abstractive, and Hybrid text summarization along with specific methods within each category. Most authors focus on the Extractive approach, but the generated summaries are very different from human summaries regardless of techniques used.

2. "Improving Factual Consistency of Text Summarization by Adversarially Decoupling Comprehension and Embellishment Abilities of LLMs" ² is a research paper that proposes a method to improve the factual consistency of text summarization.

3. "Recent Advances in DL-based Text Summarization: A Systematic Review" ³ is a study that offers a synopsis of literature on the use of DL approaches for text summarization.

4. "Recent Progress on Text Summarisation Based on BERT and GPT" ⁴ is a paper that discusses the use of pre-trained language models, especially BERT and GPT, for text summarization.

I hope this helps!
