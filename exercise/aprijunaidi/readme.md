Disease Detection and Identification of Rice Leaf Based on Improved Detection Transformer: This paper proposes a novel method that uses a Dense Higher-Level Composition Feature Pyramid Network (DHLC-FPN) and a Detection Transformer (DETR) to detect and identify three common rice leaf diseases: sheath blight, rice blast, and flax spot. The method achieves high accuracy and performance on the IDADP rice disease dataset1.
Rice Disease Detection by Image Analysis: This paper provides a method for automatically classifying diseases in rice plants by analyzing photographs of rice leaves. The method uses image processing algorithms to detect leaves and likely disease-induced lesions in the leaves2.
Rice Leaf Disease Detection with Transfer Learning Approach: This paper utilizes transfer learning approach by using three pretrained CNN models: InceptionV3, DenseNet201, and EfficientNet V2S to detect five prominent diseases of rice leaves along with healthy leaves. The paper compares the performance of these models on a custom dataset of rice leaf images3.
Rice Leaf Disease Detection Using Machine Learning Techniques: This paper presents a rice leaf disease detection system using machine learning approaches. The system detects three of the most common rice plant diseases: leaf smut, bacterial leaf blight and brown spot diseases. The system uses clear images of affected rice leaves with white background as the input4.
Rice Leaf Disease Detection and Classification Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks: This paper applies deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) to detect and classify rice leaf diseases. The paper uses four DCNN models: AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, and evaluates their performance on a dataset of 1200 rice leaf images with six classes of diseases5.
