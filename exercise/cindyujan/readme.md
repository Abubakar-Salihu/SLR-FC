Sure, here's a comparison of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Traditional Networking:

| Aspect | Software Defined Networking (SDN) | Traditional Networking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Architecture** | SDN is a networking architecture approach that enables the control and management of the network using software applications¹. | Traditional networking uses fixed and dedicated hardware devices such as routers and switches to control network traffic¹. |
| **Control Plane** | In SDN, the control plane manages network infrastructure and makes decisions about how network traffic should be handled¹. | In traditional networks, physical network devices, such as routers, switches, and firewalls, manage and direct network traffic¹. |
| **Configuration and Management** | SDN allows for more efficient network management, as network administrators can automate many tasks that would otherwise be done manually¹. | Traditional networks rely on standard networking protocols, such as TCP/IP and Ethernet, for communication between network devices¹. |
| **Programmability** | SDN improves performance by network virtualization. In SDN, software-controlled applications or APIs work as the basis of complete network management¹. | Traditional network is static and based on hardware network appliances¹. |
| **Scalability** | SDN allows for more flexible and customizable network configurations, as network infrastructure can be reconfigured on the fly¹. | Traditional network architecture was used by many companies till recent years but now a days due to its drawbacks Software Defined Network has been developed¹. |
| **Security** | SDN offers several key benefits over traditional networking approaches¹. | Inability to scale and network security and Performance are the major concern now a days in the current growing business situation¹. |
| **Cost** | SDN networks are becoming increasingly popular due to their flexibility, automation, and cost-effectiveness¹. | While traditional networks are still widely used¹. |

Please note that the specifics can vary based on the implementation and use case. For more detailed information, you may need to access the full text of the articles¹.
