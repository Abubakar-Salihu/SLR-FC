1. **Gamification as Intervention Strategy for Neuropsychological Rehabilitation**¹¹: This research discusses the use of game elements in non-entertainment contexts to enhance users’ engagement. Games are naturally appealing and introduce extra motivation in therapeutic and health promotion contexts. Gamification sets meaningful goals, provides immediate feedback, and achievement indicators, which encourage patients’ participation, modifying their role from a passive to an active one. Gamification has been used successfully for the rehabilitation of patients suffering congenital or acquired brain injury, neurodegenerative diseases, as well as for monitoring patients’ evolution, improving treatment adherence, and promoting healthy behaviors¹¹.

2. **Gamification: a Novel Approach to Mental Health Promotion**⁴⁵: This paper provides an overview of gamification approaches to mental health intervention, identifies factors that may be related to variations in treatment effectiveness, and discusses possible strategies for tailoring gamified interventions to clients’ needs⁴⁵.

3. **Recommendations for Implementing Gamification for Mental Health and Wellbeing**¹⁶²: This article interrogates the concept of gamification for mental health and wellbeing and provides research and design recommendations synthesized from the literature as well as a doctoral project that involved the co-design, development, and evaluation of a gamified mental health and wellbeing app¹⁶².

4. **A Survey on Gamification for Health Rehabilitation Care: Applications, Opportunities, and Open Challenges**⁶⁷: This paper examines and analyzes the existing gamification techniques for rehabilitation applications. A classification of rehabilitation gamification is developed based on the rehabilitation gamifying requirements and the gamification characteristics that are commonly applied in rehabilitation applications. This classification provides insight for researchers and practitioners into suitable techniques to design and apply gamification with increased motivation and sustainable engagement for rehabilitation treatment and care⁶⁷.
