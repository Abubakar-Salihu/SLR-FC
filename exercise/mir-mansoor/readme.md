Drugâ€“drug interactions (DDI) can occur when two or more drugs are used in combination.
Such interactions may enhance or weaken the efficacy of drugs, cause adverse drug reactions (ADRs) that can even be life-threatening in severe cases, 
and cause a drug to be withdrawn from the market. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
more than 10% of people take five or more drugs at the same time. Even worse, 20% of older adults take at least 10 drugs, 
which greatly increases the risk of ADR. With an increasing number of approved drugs, the possibility for interactions between drugs increases accordingly.
Therefore, predicting DDI in advance is both urgent and increasingly difficult in clinical practice. In vivo and in vitro experiments can facilitate 
the identification of DDI, but cannot be performed in some cases due to laboratory limitations and/or high cost. In this paper, we review
the research progress of machine learning in predicting unknown drug interactions. Among these methods, the literature-based method is 
special because it combines the extraction method of DDI and the prediction method of DDI. We first introduce the common databases, 
then briefly describe each method, and summarize the advantages and disadvantages of some prediction models. Finally, we discuss the 
challenges and prospects of machine learning methods in predicting drug interactions. 
This review aims to provide useful guidance for interested researchers to further promote bioinformatics algorithms to predict DDI.
