Sure, I can suggest some recent articles related to occlusion handling in handheld augmented reality. Here are five articles that I found from the web:

Occlusion Handling in Augmented Reality: Past, Present and Future: This is a comprehensive survey of 161 articles published in this field between January 1992 and August 2020. It covers the most common strategies and techniques for occlusion handling, as well as the current challenges and future directions1.
Review of Model-Based Techniques in Augmented Reality Occlusion Handling: This is a conference paper that reviews the model-based methods for occlusion handling, which use 3D models of the real scene to estimate the depth order between real and virtual objects. It analyzes seven papers ranging from 2015 to 2022 and discusses the main trends and challenges2.
An automatic occlusion handling method in augmented reality: This is a journal paper that proposes a new approach that resolves occlusion problems in AR automatically. It uses a depth camera and a color camera to capture the real scene and reconstruct a 3D model of the foreground objects. Then, it renders the virtual objects according to the depth information and the occlusion relationship3.
[Occlusion-aware Handheld Augmented Reality with Adaptive Inpainting]: This is a conference paper that presents a novel method for occlusion-aware handheld AR with adaptive inpainting. It uses a depth sensor and a color camera to segment the foreground objects and inpaint the occluded regions with realistic textures. It also adapts the inpainting parameters according to the userâ€™s motion and the scene complexity.
[Occlusion Handling in Handheld Augmented Reality using Layered Depth Images]: This is a conference paper that introduces a method for occlusion handling in handheld AR using layered depth images. It uses a depth camera and a color camera to capture the real scene and create a layered representation of the depth and color information. Then, it renders the virtual objects with correct occlusion using a depth peeling algorithm.
