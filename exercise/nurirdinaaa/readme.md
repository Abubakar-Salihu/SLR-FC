Certainly! Here's an abstract for a review paper related to game design models for virtual reality games that enhance cognitive performance of the users:

"Enhancing cognitive ability through a VR serious game training model mixing Piaget’s epistemological methodology and Lumosity concept" ¹ is a study that explores the use of virtual reality games to improve cognitive function in children. The study uses Piaget's cognitive development theory and the Lumosity brain training platform to develop a training model for enhancing cognitive abilities among children. The game design process incorporates different game elements to avoid repetition of trainers in terms of gameplay, logical scenes, and task elements. The study concludes that the cognitive training model developed can improve cognitive ability in children with cognitive impairment.

I hope this helps!
