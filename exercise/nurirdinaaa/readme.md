Here are five recent articles related to game design models and cognitive enhancement:

1. "Effectiveness of digital educational game and game design in STEM learning: a meta-analytic review" ¹ is a study that investigates the efficacy of digital game-based learning and its designs in STEM education. The study found that digital educational games exhibit substantial promise in advancing STEM education, and that digital game-based STEM learning is differentially effective for different learning outcomes, types of games, and subjects.

2. "A game-factors approach to cognitive benefits from video-game training" ² is a study that explores the cognitive benefits of video-game training. The study uses a game-factors approach to identify the game elements that contribute to cognitive benefits, such as attention, memory, and problem-solving.

3. "Enhancing cognitive ability through a VR serious game training model mixing Piaget’s epistemological methodology and Lumosity concept" ³ is a study that uses virtual reality games to improve cognitive function in children. The study uses Piaget's cognitive development theory and the Lumosity brain training platform to develop a training model for enhancing cognitive abilities among children.

4. "Effects of computer gaming on cognition, brain structure, and function: A critical reflection on existing literature" ⁴ is a study that critically reflects on the existing literature on the effects of computer gaming on cognition, brain structure, and function. The study reports the effects of action video games on attentional control, but refrains from drawing general conclusions.

5. "Electronic Science Games Used to Enhance Cognitive Ability in the Elderly" ⁵ is a study that discusses the research status and design methods of electronic science games to enhance cognitive ability in the elderly. The study highlights the advantages and challenges of personalized and adaptive design in electronic science games.

Certainly! Here's an abstract for a review paper related to game design models for virtual reality games that enhance cognitive performance of the users:

"Enhancing cognitive ability through a VR serious game training model mixing Piaget’s epistemological methodology and Lumosity concept" ¹ is a study that explores the use of virtual reality games to improve cognitive function in children. The study uses Piaget's cognitive development theory and the Lumosity brain training platform to develop a training model for enhancing cognitive abilities among children. The game design process incorporates different game elements to avoid repetition of trainers in terms of gameplay, logical scenes, and task elements. The study concludes that the cognitive training model developed can improve cognitive ability in children with cognitive impairment.
