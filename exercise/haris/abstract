“Multi-view co-clustering with multi-similarity” 1 is a research paper published in the journal Applied Intelligence in December 2022. The authors propose a multi-view co-clustering algorithm based on multi-similarity to cluster the two dimensions of samples and features of multi-view data simultaneously. The proposed algorithm exploits the more comprehensive similarity information in each view data, including sample-sample, feature-feature, and sample-feature similarity information. The authors use multiple co-clustering algorithms to calculate the similarity information of each view data, which makes the algorithm more robust. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on several benchmark datasets, and the experimental results are better than the comparison method in the three evaluation indicators.

The proposed algorithm has several advantages over existing methods. First, it can handle incomplete data and missing views effectively. Second, it can capture the intrinsic structure of multi-view data and improve the clustering performance. Third, it can be applied to various fields, such as image processing, text mining, and bioinformatics. The proposed algorithm has great potential for practical applications in real-world problems.
