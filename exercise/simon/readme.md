Sure, here's a brief summary of each paper:

1. **Data augmentation for improving deep learning in image classification problem**¹: This paper focuses on the lack of sufficient training data or uneven class balance within datasets. It compares and analyzes multiple methods of data augmentation in image classification, from classical image transformations like rotating, cropping, zooming, histogram-based methods to Style Transfer and Generative Adversarial Networks¹.

2. **A survey on Image Data Augmentation for Deep Learning**[^10^]: This survey paper discusses various image augmentation algorithms including geometric transformations, color space augmentations, kernel filters, mixing images, random erasing, feature space augmentation, adversarial training, generative adversarial networks, neural style transfer, and meta-learning[^10^].

3. **Research on data augmentation for image classification based on deep convolution Neural network**¹³: This paper explores the impact of various data augmentation methods on image classification tasks with deep convolution Neural network. It uses Alexnet as the pre-training network model and a subset of CIFAR10 and ImageNet (10 categories) as the original dataset¹³.

4. **The Effectiveness of Data Augmentation in Image Classification using Deep Learning**¹⁷: This paper explores and compares multiple solutions to the problem of data augmentation in image classification. It demonstrates the effectiveness of data augmentation through simple techniques, such as cropping, rotating, and flipping input images¹⁷.

5. **Image Augmentation with Convolutional Neural Networks**⁶: This paper discusses how data augmentation can enhance the size and quality of training datasets in order to build up better Deep Learning models. It presents a convolutional neural network model with image augmentation to combat overfitting⁶.

In summary, these papers collectively highlight the importance and effectiveness of various data augmentation techniques in improving the performance of deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), in image classification tasks. They explore a range of augmentation methods, from simple transformations to more complex techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks and neural style transfer. The papers also underscore the role of data augmentation in addressing challenges such as overfitting and limited data availability.
