The first article is titled Componentized Task Scheduling in Cloud-Edge Cooperative Scenarios Based on GNN-enhanced DRL. The authors propose a new algorithm called Cloud-edge Collaborative Task Scheduling (CCTS) Algorithm based on hybrid reward architecture deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to balance the task execution efficiency, network traffic, and system load balance in componentized task deployment. The authors use directed graph convolution networks and graph convolution networks (GCN) to embed the directed task graph and undirected network graph, respectively. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a real-world dataset, and the results show that it outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of task execution efficiency and system load balance.
