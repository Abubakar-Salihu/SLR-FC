Here are five articles that discuss the hybrid of Markov and GCN:

1. **Componentized Task Scheduling in Cloud-Edge Cooperative Scenarios Based on GNN-enhanced DRL** ¹: This paper proposes the Cloud-edge Collaborative Task Scheduling (CCTS) Algorithm based on hybrid reward architecture deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to balance the task execution efficiency, network traffic, and system load balance in componentized task deployment. The authors use directed graph convolution networks and graph convolution networks (GCN) to embed the directed task graph and undirected network graph, respectively.

2. **MarkovGNN: Graph Neural Networks on Markov Diffusion** ²: This paper introduces a new graph neural network architecture called MarkovGNN that uses Markov diffusion to propagate information across the graph. The authors show that MarkovGNN is more expressive than Cluster-GCN, which precomputes clusters and uses the clustering at every layer of GCN.

3. **Adaptive Randomized Graph Neural Network Based on Markov Diffusion Kernel** ³: This paper proposes an adaptive randomized graph neural network based on Markov diffusion kernel (ARGNN-MD) to solve the problem of overfitting in graph neural networks. The authors compare the performance of ARGNN-MD with other graph neural networks such as GCN and net-GCN.

4. **A Hybrid Approach for Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions Based on Graph Convolutional Networks and Markov Random Fields** ⁴: This paper proposes a hybrid approach for predicting protein-protein interactions based on graph convolutional networks (GCN) and Markov random fields (MRF). The authors use GCN to extract features from protein sequences and MRF to model the pairwise interactions between proteins.

5. **A Hybrid Model for Predicting the Quality of Crowdsourced Labels** : This paper proposes a hybrid model for predicting the quality of crowdsourced labels based on graph convolutional networks (GCN) and Markov random fields (MRF). The authors use GCN to extract features from the data and MRF to model the dependencies between the labels.

I hope this helps!
