| Context-Aware Misbehavior Detection Scheme for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks using Sequential Analysis of the Temporal and Spatial Correlation of the Cooperative Awareness Messages | To propose a context-aware MDS that uses statistical methods to check the consistency and plausibility of the messages received from neighboring vehicles in VANETs | The scheme uses the Kalman filter, Box-plot, and Hampel filter to construct and update a dynamic context reference model based on the temporal and spatial consistency and plausibility of the CAMs | The scheme can detect various types of attacks and reduce the false alarm rate and the detection delay | The scheme can adapt to the changing network conditions and provide more accurate and reliable detection results | The scheme requires a high computational cost and a large storage space |
