Sure, here is the table you asked for:

| Aspect | SDN-Based (Proposed System) | AI-Based | IoV |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cost | Economical, no need high computing device to train and not depend on good resource for established the communication | Substantial, necessitating intricate algorithms and computational resources. AI predicated solutions may demand significant capital for data acquisition and processing (Man et al., 2023). | Intermediate, contingent on the quantity and type of vehicular and sensory apparatus involved. IoV may necessitate considerable capital for infrastructural and technological development (Yang, 2021). |
| Efficiency | Optimal, facilitating dynamic and flexible configuration and optimization of the traffic management system | Optimal, enabling intelligent and adaptive network decision making and learning. AI has the potential to optimize traffic signals, alleviate congestion, and enhance fuel efficiency. | Moderate, confronting challenges such as high mobility, frequent handovers, and heterogeneous networks. IoV can expedite real-time data exchange on roads, bolstering traffic management. |
| Robustness | Moderate, reliant on the reliability and security of the centralized controller. SDN provides a centralized control, augmenting the robustness. | Moderate, contingent on the accuracy and robustness of the AI models and data. The robustness of AI predicated solutions is dependent on the quality of the data and the efficacy of the algorithms. | Low, susceptible to network congestion, interference, and attacks. The robustness of IoV is dependent on the reliability of the vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. |
