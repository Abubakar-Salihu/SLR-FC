The article titled "Application of Intelligent Technology in Urban Traffic Congestion" discusses the use of intelligent technology to alleviate urban traffic congestion, particularly high-traffic vehicle traffic¹. The paper investigates and researches existing intelligent technology and discusses how to apply this mature technology to urban traffic planning and control systems to alleviate urban traffic congestion¹. The phenomenon of urban traffic congestion has largely restricted the overall efficiency of the traffic planning control network¹. The paper suggests that effective management of urban traffic congestion will affect the healthy and sustainable development of the domestic economy¹. The full article was published in the 2020 International Conference on Computer Engineering and Application (ICCEA)¹.
