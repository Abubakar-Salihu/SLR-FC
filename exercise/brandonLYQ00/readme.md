Sure, here are the summaries of the articles:

1. **GT-NRSM: efficient and scalable sharding consensus mechanism for consortium blockchain**¹: This article proposes a node reliable shard model based on a guarantee tree for consortium blockchain. The model achieves high scalability while maintaining a certain degree of decentralization and security. The authors designed a reliable node selection strategy based on the guarantee mechanism to evaluate the node guarantee results and consensus behavior, determine the node trust status, and identify malicious nodes and choose a list of trusted leaders. The proposed algorithm improves throughput by 48% over Raft and is significantly greater than PBFT, which has better throughput but lower consensus latency.

2. **ShardCons - A Sharding Based Consensus Algorithm for Blockchain**²: The authors present a novel consensus algorithm for public blockchain which shards the miners based on their performance. The algorithm solves one of the main problems of public blockchain which is scalability issue. This performance-based consensus algorithm also ensures more fairness, avoids starvation, improves the trust among the miners, and enhances the overall performance of the blockchain network.

Please note that these summaries are based on the abstracts of the articles and for more detailed information, you should refer to the full articles.
